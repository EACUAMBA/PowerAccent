# How it works
Press and hold letter then hit space bar or arrow key to select the accent. For example `e` & `‚éµ`. With spacebar, repeat stroke to change letter. When releasing the letter key, the accent is inserted.

The software is currently working with the most of accents for several countries, including `Czech`, `German`, `France`, `Maori`, and many others... (the list can be found [here](https://github.com/damienleroy/PowerAccent/blob/main/PowerAccent.Core/Languages.cs)). If any langage is missing, don't hesitate to create an [issue](https://github.com/damienleroy/PowerAccent/issues).

All accents are ordered by usage frequency ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_frequency)) by default.

# Problem known
- Some keys can have weird behavior with some actions or some tools
- (Experimental feature) Inside browsers & some other softwares, the tool can't detect the caret position. So default is applied, meaning up center of the main window

# The future
- More accents
- Theme & design improvement
- Some others features [asked](https://github.com/damienleroy/PowerAccent/issues)
