# How it works
Press and hold letter then hit space bar or arrow key to select the accent. For example `e` & `‚éµ`. With spacebar, repeat stroke to change letter. When releasing the letter key, the accent is inserted.

The software is currently working with `a`, `c`, `e`, `i`, `o`, `u`, `y`.
All accents are ordered by usage frequency: https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fr%C3%A9quence_d%27apparition_des_lettres_en_fran%C3%A7ais

# Problem known
- Only available for windows
- (Experimental feature) Inside browsers & some other softwares, the tool can't detect the caret position. So default is applied, meaning up center of the main window

# The future
- Special characters
- More accents
- More options by country
- Theme & design improvement
