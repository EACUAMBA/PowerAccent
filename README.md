# How it works
Use a letter and the left or right arrow to select the accent. For example `e` & `<-`. When releasing the letter key, the accent is inserted.

The software is currently working with `a`, `c`, `e`, `i`, `o`, `u`, `y`.

# Problem known
- Inside browsers & some other softwares, the tool can't detect the caret position. So default is applied, meaning up center of the main window
- Only available for windows
- The position of the window can stay on the main screen with multi-monitor configuration

# The future
- Caps integration
- Theme & design improvement
- Choose screen position
